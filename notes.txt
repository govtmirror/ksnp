Tree types
-Allele Counts -> labeled internal node with shared SNPs at a node
-Tip Allele counts -> as above with SNPs at tips exclusive to strain
-Node lable -> as Allele Cont with node number

Phylogenetic trees
-All trees are made using parisomony informative unless specified as ML or NJ.  ML may be better with bacteria.
-Parisomony informative is shown to be most accurate most often
-ML and NJ trees are created using all SNPs
-By default parisomony trees are made using all, majority and core SNPs
-Because a concatamer of SNPs trees scale is relative to total SNPs, not per SNP changes

Skeleton workflow
-Within a single genome allele conflicts are removed.  Conflicts are more than one SNP tpe in kmer
-Find kmers with allelic variation across genomes
-Find SNP positions in finished genomes
-Build matrix and trees
-Cluster groups/nodes
-Annotate

Homoplastic SNPs map to multiple nodes

Run in debug mode to keep all files output by kSNP
